# pushy
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kibu-australia/pushy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kibu-australia/pushy)

A Clojurescript library for quick and easy HTML5 pushState.

## Install

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/kibu/pushy/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/kibu/pushy)

## Usage

### Setup

You can construct a new instance by calling the `pushy` function.

`pushy` takes in two arguments:

* `dispatch` fn: gets called when there is a match
* `match` fn: checks if the path matches any routes defined.

Optionally, you can pass in an `identity` fn which parses and returns the route based on the result of the `match` fn

### Event listeners

You can start the event listeners with the `start!` method.

This adds an event listener to all `click` events, which dispatches on all matched routes.
Bypasses on Alt, Shift, Meta, Ctrl keys and middle clicks.

The `stop!` method will tear down all event listeners of the pushy instance.

### Routing libraries

pushy should work with any routing library:

[Secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary)

```clojure
(ns foo.core
  (:require [secretary.core :as secretary :include-macros true :refer-macros [defroute]]
            [pushy.core :as pushy]))

(secretary/set-config! :prefix "/")

(defroute index "/" []
  (.log js/console "Hi"))

(def history (pushy/pushy secretary/dispatch!
                          (fn [x] (when (secretary/locate-route x) x))))

;; Start event listeners
(pushy/start! history)
```

[Bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi)

```clojure
(ns foo.core
  (:require [bidi.bidi :as bidi]
            [pushy.core :as pushy))

(def state (atom {}))

(def app-routes
  ["/" {"foo" :foo}])

(defn set-page! [match]
  (swap! state assoc :page match))

(def history
  (pushy/pushy set-page! (partial bidi/match-route app-routes)))

(pushy/start! history)
```

### goog.history.HTML5History methods

You can set the history state manually by calling the `set-token!` method. This will call the `dispatch` fn on a successfully matched path.

Example:

```clojure
(set-token! history "/foo")

(get-token history)
;; => /foo
```

Likewise, you can call `replace-token!` which will also call the `dispatch` fn and replace the current history state without affecting the rest of the history stack.
